# Short course description


This course introduces students to regression as a tool to answer questions about education. Regression is commonly used to answer questions about "association claims" -- the relationship between variables -- and "causal claims" -- the causal effect of one variable on another. However, using regression appropriately requires thoughtfulness about what kinds of questions regression can answer, about the assumptions regression relies on, about the limitations of our data, and about how particular variables (e.g., "race" and "gender") are incorporated into analyses. Otherwise, regression results may be biased and may reify rather than interrogate problematic ideas. Therefore, EDUC152 introduces students to fundamental concepts of regression analysis and how these concepts can be thoughtfully applied to address important questions about education. The course also trains students how to read and critically assess research that uses regression. ECUC152 integrates theory and application using the **_R_** programming language. Students will be assessed through four substantive take-home assignments, including the final, capstone assignment.

# Extended course description

[HAVE NOT UPDATED SINCE LAST MEETING]

Regression is the most widely-used quantitative methodology to answer causal, and also non-causal, research questions. This section of EDUC152 will introduce students to regression with a focus on using regression to answer causal research questions, which typicaly follow the form "what is the effect of X on Y." The course also emphasizes undersanding how to read and critically assess empirical research that uses regression.

The course integrates statistical theory and application using the **_R_** programming language.  Students will work through asynchronous video lectures and lectures slides on their own. These lectures introduces statistical theory, introduces the relevant programming skills, and provides the code and real-world data so that students can practice conducting and interpreting statistical analyses. Course topics will include: fundamental statistical concepts of statistical inference; principles of causal inference; and fundamentals of multiple regression.  During class time, students will work in groups to solve practical research challenges and we will discuss and deconstruct empirical research that uses regression analysis. The primary course assessments are four problem sets -- including the final capstone problem set -- which will be completed in groups. Each problem set will require students to apply knowledge of statistical concepts, and conduct substantive statistical analyses around a particular research question. 

```{r, eval = FALSE, include = FALSE}
The primary course assessments are four problem sets, including the final capstone problem set.  Each problem set will require students to apply knowledge of statistical concepts, conduct substantive statistical analyses, present and interpret results. Problem sets will also be designed to introduce students to some of the thorny data challenges that inevitably arise in real research projects.  The final, capstone problem set will require students to conduct the major components of an empirical regression analysis, from research question and variable collection to modeling, presentation, and interpretation. Additionally, the capstone problem set will require students to critically evaluate an empirical journal article that utilized the same data sources to answer the same research question.
```

The course embraces using regression to answer traditional research questions (e.g., the effect of student-teacher ratio on achievement) and critical research questions (e.g., the effect of racial salience -- as presented in email text -- on how white university admissions officers respond to inquiries from Black prospective students). The skills this course teaches are valued by employers and are valued in the process of applying to graduate schools. After completing this course, students will be prepared to take more advanced causal inference coursework (e.g., quasi-experimental methods) and coursework that teaches the programming and data manipulation skills necessary to create analysis datasets for real research projects.

# Course structure and how to succeed

## Course structure

Each week, the course will be structured around asynchronous (pre-class) lectures and one synchronous workshop-style class meeting per week. Weekly homework will consist of students working through the lectures on their own and a modest amount of required reading. Written homework will consist of four "problem sets." Students will complete the first three problem sets in groups. Students will complete the final capstone problem set, due during finals week, on their own.

1. __Asynchronous (pre-class) lectures__. Weekly asynchronous lectures will be posted on the course website with the expectation that students work through the lecture in advance of our weekly synchronous class meeting. Lecture materials will consist of three types of resources: first, detailed lecture slides (PDF or HTML) introducing the statistical theory, programming skills, and sample code; second, short videos (e.g., 15 to 30 total minutes per week) that provide a high-level discussion of important and/or challenging concepts from the lecture slides, but not a line-by-line recitation of the lecture; and, third, the .Rmd file that created the PDF/html lecture slides. This .Rmd file will contain all "code chunks" and links to all data utilized in the lecture. Thus, students will be able to "learn by doing" in that they can run R code on their own computer while they work through lecture materials on their own.
1. __Synchronous workshop-style class meetings.__ We will have one synchronous class meeting per week. Typically, these meetings will begin with a discussion of concepts students found difficult or confusing from the lecture materials. However, the bulk of class time will be devoted to students working in groups on a substantive question or challenge posed by the instructor. For example, students may be asked to create analysis variables from survey data in the presence of skip patterns or how we could improve on the analyses conducted in a research article students read prior to class. While students work in groups, the instructor and TA will visit with each group to answer questions and talk through ideas.

## How to succeed in this class

Prior to our in-class meetings, students should work through lecture materials on their own. We recommend treating the lecture materials as an active learning experience, in which students run *R* code on their computer instead of merely reading text on the slide. Additionally, we recommend that students ask questions on the course github website when they are having difficulty with the material.

With respect to written work, the problem sets -- described below -- will be substantive and are intended to be challenging. Students who devote time each week working through the lecture materials will be better prepared for the problem sets. We recommend starting the problem sets early. This way students will have plenty of time to ask for help on questions they find challenging.

## Classroom environment

<!-- 
# Creating an Inclusive Classroom Community 
(Instructor, TA, and Community Expectations)
## Respect for diversity  
 -->

We all have a responsibility to ensure that every member of the class feels valued and safe. 
Be mindful that our words and body language affects others in ways we not fully understand. We have a responsibility to express our ideas in a way that doesn't make disparaging generalizations and doesn't make people feel excluded. As an instructor, I am responsible for setting an example through my own conduct.

Learning regression, while trying to get a handle on R and unfamiliar data can feel overwhelming! We must create an environment where students feel comfortable asking questions and talking about what they did not understand. Discomfort is part of the learning process. Unburdern yourself from the weight of being an "expert." Focus your energy on improving and helping your classmates improve.

##  Towards an anti-racist learning experience

Every course should be an anti-racist course, even when the subject matter is broadly oriented. In this course we’ll engage with research that reflect systemic gaps based on race, ethnicity, immigration status, and gender identity, among other aspects of identity. We will discuss whether the language, the framing, the analyses, and even the research question of a study contribute to problematic beliefs. If so, how can we do better? It is also critical that we acknowledge that the social and economic marginalization reflected in data is rooted in systemic oppression that upholds opportunity for some at the expense of others. We should all be thinking about our own role in upholding these systems.

# Course website and communication

## Course website

All course related material can be found on the class website [here]. Pre-recorded lecture videos, lecture slides (pdf, html), and .Rmd files will be posted on the class website under the associated sections. Additional resources (e.g. syllabus) may also be posted on the class website. Class announcements and discussion will be conducted on GitHub (see below). 

## Course discussion

COMMENTS: 

- COMMITTED TO USING SLACK INSTEAD OF GITHUB

- 

- if you are going to use github for course communication; then this should be tied to a learning goal; `
- We will be using GitHub teams for class announcements.    


  - __GitHub teams__: The teaching team will post all class announcements using GitHub teams. The GitHub team discussions feature allows for quick and seamless communication to all members of an organization or team-- in this case, to all students with a GitHub account enrolled in the course. Some features include:  
  
    1. The class team can be viewed and [`@mentioned`](https://docs.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-people-and-teams) by all students enrolled in the class and part of the organization.  
    2. Posts can include code snippets, links, images, and references to issues which make them ideal for this class discussion and participation.

  - __GitHub issues__: GitHub issues are traditionally used by collaborators of a repository for managing tasks for a project. Our rational for using issues is twofold: 1) help track and organize questions related to course material and problem sets and 2) promote classroom participation. Students are encouraged to contribute to issues by posting questions, sharing helpful resources, and/or taking a stab at answering questions posted on issues. Some features include: 
    
    1. Adding labels  
    2. Assigning or mentioning users to an issue 
    3. Referencing other issues

# Assignments and grading

Course grade will be based on the following components:

- Problem set 1, 15%
- Problem set 2, 15%
- Problem set 3, 15%
- Problem set 4, 30%
- In-class group activities, 15%
- Attendance and participation, 10%

## Assignments

### Problem sets (75 percent of total grade)

The primary course assessments are four problem sets. The first three problem sets are each worth 15% of the course grade and students will work in groups. The final, capstone problem set is worth 30% and students will work alone. 

Each problem set will require students to apply knowledge of statistical concepts, conduct substantive statistical analyses, present and interpret results. Other questions will introduce students to some of the thorny data challenges that inevitably arise in real research projects. The capstone problem set will require students to conduct the major components of an empirical regression analysis, from research question and variable collection to modeling, presentation, and interpretation. Additionally, the capstone problem set will require students to critically evaluate an empirical journal article that utilized the same data sources to answer the same research question.


You will work in groups for the first three problem sets. **However, it is important that you understand how to do the problem set on your own, rather than copying the solution developed by group members.**  Each student will submit their own R script or .Rmd file. Since you will be working together, it is understandable that answers for some questions will be the same as your group members. However, if I find compelling evidence that a student merely copied solutions from a classmate, I will consider this a violation of academic integrity and that student will receive a zero for the homework assignment.

Late submissions will lose 20% (i.e., max grade becomes 80%). Problem sets not submitted by XXXX will not receive points. You will not lose points for late submission if you cannot submit a problem set due to an unexpected emergency. But please contact the instructor by email as soon as you can so we can work out a plan.

We strongly recommend using GitHub issues to ask questions you have about problem sets. Instructors will do our best to reply quickly with helpful hints/explanations and we encourage members of the class to do the same.

More detailed problem set guidelines can be found here [link]

-->

## In-class group activities (15 percent of total grade)

During most synchronous class sessions, students will work on a group activity or challenge that applies concepts and skills we are learning. For example, Run a statistical test in *R* and use the test results object to create a formatted table that you insert into a .Rmd file. Or, write a draft critique of the methodology of a published research paper. Students will submit their work at the end of class. 
Most of these tasks cannot be fully completed. The goal is to get students thinking. Students will be graded largely based on effort.

## Attendance and Participation (10 percent of total grade)

Students are expected to participate in the weekly class meetings by being attentive, supportive, by asking questions, or by answering questions posed by others on zoom. Additionally, students can receive strong participation grades by asking questions and answering questions on GitHub issues.

## Academic integrity

__UCLA policy__  

  - UCLA is a community of scholars. In this community, all members including faculty, staff and students alike are responsible for maintaining standards of academic honesty. As a student and member of the University community, you are here to get an education and are, therefore, expected to demonstrate integrity in your academic endeavors. You are evaluated on your own merits. Cheating, plagiarism, collaborative work, multiple submissions without the permission of the professor, or other kinds of academic dishonesty are considered unacceptable behavior and will result in formal disciplinary proceedings.  
  
__This class__  

  - Given that 75% of course grade is based on problem sets, the primary academic honesty concern that could come up in this class is copying problem set solutions from somebody else and passing this in as your own work.
